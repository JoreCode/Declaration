Hello Universe, 

I am writing this to you to tell you that I am here to work
with you. I know that you reward those who strive to more
and push themselves outside of what they recognize as comfortable. 
I fully intend to push beyond what I previously have shown
I am capable of. I will get to heights no one thought I could, 
not even myself. I will bring Theresa with me. She is a talent
human who I want by my side at all times. I love her, she has
brought me so much understanding of myself. She has helped me
understand my true power. This is a declaration for my future 
self and for you. I will see you not long from now. The journey 
will be amazing. It will be full of challenge, stress, trials, 
doubt, and fear. However, I know it will all be worth it. I 
will see you at the top. Thank you. You have already given me
so much. 

Josh
